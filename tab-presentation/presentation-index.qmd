Here we can add links to presentations.

For now you can access the presentation by adjusting the URL below with your details

https://YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT.github.io/NAME-OF-YOUR-GIT-REPO/tab-presentation/presentation1/presentation-example.html

Simply change my capitalized text for your: 
i) your github username   
ii) the name of your github repo
then copy the URL and paste it to visit the webpage. 

The adjusted URL above should take you to an example of a simple Quarto presentation.
